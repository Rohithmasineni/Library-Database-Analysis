# Library-Database-Analysis

This project demonstrates the creation of a relational database for a library management system using SQL. It includes database design, data import, and solving key business questions through SQL queries.  

---

## Key Components  

1. **Database Creation**:  
   - Built a database named `library` using SQL Workbench.  

2. **Table Design**:  
   - Created 7 tables:  
     - `tbl_book`  
     - `tbl_book_authors`  
     - `tbl_publisher`  
     - `tbl_book_copies`  
     - `tbl_library_branch`  
     - `tbl_book_loans`  
     - `tbl_borrower`  
   - Included appropriate constraints like **Primary Keys, Foreign Keys (with CASCADE actions), NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT**, etc.  

3. **Data Import**:  
   - Imported data from 7 CSV files into the database using the Data Import Wizard.  

4. **SQL Queries for Business Problems**:  
   - Solved real-world business questions using SQL queries, including:  
     - Counting book copies by branches and titles.  
     - Identifying borrowers without checked-out books.  
     - Retrieving loan and borrower details based on due dates.  
     - Aggregating data at branch and borrower levels.

## Learning Outcomes  

- Mastery in designing relational databases with constraints.  
- Practical experience in importing and validating data.  
- Proficiency in **Joins**, **Aggregate Functions**, and filtering data with `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses.
